ExamWeightedGrader
==================

Program that reads a list of student scores and outputs their grades, weighted out of the whole. Class assignment for COSC 600.

## Assignment

Project 1 **COSC 600** Spring 2014  
Professor: H. Zhou  
Due: Feb 14, 2014  

Write a Java program for the following problem. You are given a collection of scores (type int) for the last exam in your computer course. You are to compute the average of these scores and assign grades(O,S,U) to each student according to the following rules:
 
Outstanding: if the score is more than 10% above the average  
Satisfactory: if the score is 10% within(above or below) the average  
Unsatisfactory: if the score is more than 10% below the average  

Read the following data from a file and then use them to test your program:

    55 98 89 62 78 69 91 83 99 52

The output from your program should consist of a labeled two-column list that shows each score and its corresponding grade. Send the output to a file. You will need methods to read the data, to write the student data, to compute the mean score, and to assign a letter grade based on the exam score and the mean score. Use at least two difference classes to design the program, such as a Driver class and an AssignScore class.

Submit the java program along with the output file to our class website.
